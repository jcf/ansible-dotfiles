RUBY						*ruby.vim* *ft-ruby-syntax*

There are a number of options to the Ruby syntax highlighting.

By default, the "end" keyword is colorized according to the opening statement
of the block it closes.  While useful, this feature can be expensive; if you
experience slow redrawing (or you are on a terminal with poor color support)
you may want to turn it off by defining the "ruby_no_expensive" variable: >

	:let ruby_no_expensive = 1
<
In this case the same color will be used for all control keywords.

If you do want this feature enabled, but notice highlighting errors while
scrolling backwards, which are fixed when redrawing with CTRL-L, try setting
the "ruby_minlines" variable to a value larger than 50: >

	:let ruby_minlines = 100
<
Ideally, this value should be a number of lines large enough to embrace your
largest class or module.

Highlighting of special identifiers can be disabled by removing the
rubyIdentifier highlighting: >

	:hi link rubyIdentifier NONE
<
This will prevent highlighting of special identifiers like "ConstantName",
"$global_var", "@@class_var", "@instance_var", "| block_param |", and
":symbol".

Significant methods of Kernel, Module and Object are highlighted by default.
This can be disabled by defining "ruby_no_special_methods": >

	:let ruby_no_special_methods = 1
<
This will prevent highlighting of important methods such as "require", "attr",
"private", "raise" and "proc".

Ruby operators can be highlighted. This is enabled by defining
"ruby_operators": >

	:let ruby_operators = 1
<
Whitespace errors can be highlighted by defining "ruby_space_errors": >

	:let ruby_space_errors = 1
<
This will highlight trailing whitespace and tabs preceded by a space character
as errors.  This can be refined by defining "ruby_no_trail_space_error" and
"ruby_no_tab_space_error" which will ignore trailing whitespace and tabs after
spaces respectively.

Folding can be enabled by defining "ruby_fold": >

	:let ruby_fold = 1
<
This will set the 'foldmethod' option to "syntax" and allow folding of
classes, modules, methods, code blocks, heredocs and comments.

Folding of multiline comments can be disabled by defining
"ruby_no_comment_fold": >

	:let ruby_no_comment_fold = 1
<
