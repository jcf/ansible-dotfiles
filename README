= James Conroy-Finn dotfiles

== Installation

  git clone git://github.com/jamesconroyfinn/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  rake install
  # edit ~/.gitconfig and personalize it


== Environment

I'm using these configuration on OS X and Linux. The only OS-based logic is used in the `ls` alias and uses either --color-auto or -G to use colour when listing files and folders.

== Origins

This setup was influenced by Ryan Bates and his rake based dotfiles. You can Ryan's git repo at http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles
