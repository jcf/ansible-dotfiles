# James Conroy-Finn dotfiles

## Installation

  git clone git://github.com/jcf/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  rake install

## Environment

I'm using these configuration on OS X and Linux. The only OS-based logic is
used in the `ls` alias and uses either `--color-auto` or `-G` to use colour
when listing files and folders.

## Origins

This setup was influenced by Ryan Bates and his rake based dotfiles. You can
find [Ryan's](http://github.com/ryanb) [git
repo](http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles)
