# dotfiles

### Handcrafted with all the love in the world.

# Setup

To get started you'll want to install Homebrew as it's required to
install development dependencies.

With Homebrew installed there's a dotfiles executable in `bin/dotfiles`.

``` sh
PATH="./bin:$PATH" dotfiles install
```

All the logic behind `dotfiles` can be found in the libexec directory.
