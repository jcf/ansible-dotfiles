# Installation

    git clone git://github.com/jcf/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    rake install

## Features

All my lazy aliases, a cool, minimalist ZSH prompt and loads of Vim
configuration files and bundled plugins!

## Origins

This setup was influenced by Ryan Bates and his rake based dotfiles. You can
find [Ryan's](http://github.com/ryanb) [git
repo](http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles)
