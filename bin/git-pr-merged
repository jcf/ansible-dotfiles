# Usage: git-pr-merged [ref]
#
# This command will checkout master, update it via a rebase, and then delete
# the branch that has been merged (most likely via a pull request).
#
# Without any arguments the current branch will be used as the branch to
# delete. An optional argument can be provided to specify a different branch to
# use.
