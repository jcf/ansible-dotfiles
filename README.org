The following repositories configure Emacs, ZSH, and Vim:

- [[https://github.com/jcf/spacemacs.d][spacemacs.d]] contains my Spacemacs customisations.
- [[https://github.com/jcf/prezto][prezto]] configures ZSH.
- [[https://github.com/jcf/vimrc][vimrc]] sets up Vim for those times when Emacs isn't available.

And there's pretty good support for the following languages:

- [[http://clojure.org/][Clojure]]
- [[http://golang.org/][Go]]
- [[http://www.erlang.org/][Erlang]]
- [[https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat][Javascript]] via [[https://github.com/creationix/nvm][nvm]]
- [[https://www.haskell.org/][Haskell]]
- [[https://www.python.org/][Python]] via [[https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv][pyenv]]
- [[https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/][Ruby]] via [[https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv][rbenv]]

Each feature/language is grouped using [[http://www.ansible.com/][Ansible]] roles, and can be found in the
[[https://github.com/jcf/dotfiles/tree/master/roles][roles]] directory.

All the dotfiles that get linked into =$HOME= are grouped by language or feature
where possible, and failing that lumped into the =dotfiles= role.

Roles look at the =vars= kept in [[https://github.com/jcf/dotfiles/tree/master/group_vars][group_vars]] for things like packages to install,
and versions of certain runtime environments.

** Getting Started

You'll need the following dependencies before getting started.

- [[http://www.ansible.com/][Ansible]]
- [[http://brew.sh/][Homebrew]]
- [[https://developer.apple.com/xcode/][Xcode]]

At the time of writing it's possible to get all three like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
  sudo python get-pip.py

  ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

  xcode-select --install
#+END_SRC

** Installation

With the dependencies above installed you can clone the repo, and use [[http://www.ansible.com/][Ansible]] to
get everything setup!

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone git://github.com/jcf/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles

  bin/install

  # This needs root access and will ask for your password
  bin/sudo-install
#+END_SRC

** Keeping up to date

To update the installed packages and tools you can use =bin/update=, which
internally runs all Ansible tasks with the tag =update=.
